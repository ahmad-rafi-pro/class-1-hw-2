        <p align="left"><b>Uncertainty</b> is the beauty of life. After the birth of every living thing only death is certain. But the time or the moment of death is totally uncertain to us.
            Only Allah knows the time of death of every living thing. Everything is certain for Him beacause He is above time. If our life is a sea then uncertainty is just a drop of water of that sea.
            The experience of uncertainty can be challenging, as it can disrupt our sense of stability and control. A believer can plan for the future but only hope for the best. Allah tests us with uncertainty. 
            Its makes our happy moments happy and sad moments sad. If we know whats going to happen tomorrow, we will feel nothing when it happens. Not knowing the future makes us feel those happy or sad moments in life.

        <p align="left">In ever-changing and unpredictable world; accepting and embracing uncertainty becomes crucial. Embracing uncertainty can lead to personal growth and resilience, enabling us to navigate through
             the complexities of life with greater flexibility and open-mindness. It requires us to cultivate patience, tolerrance for ambiguity and the ability to make deccisions even in the absence of complete information.
            Uncertainty can manifest in various aspects of life, incliding personal relationships, career choices, finacial decisions and global events. It stems from the complexity and interconnectedness of the world we live in, where
            multiple factors and variables interact in unpredictable ways.

            <pre align="center">
    I look at the world 
    From awakening eyes in a black face— 
    And this is what I see: This fenced-off narrow space 
    Assigned to me.

    I look then at the silly walls 
    Through dark eyes in a dark face— 
    And this is what I know: 
    That all these walls oppression builds 
    Will have to go! 
                
    I look at my own body 
    With eyes no longer blind— 
    And I see that my own hands can make 
    The world that’s in my mind. 
    Then let us hurry, comrades, 
    The road to find.
